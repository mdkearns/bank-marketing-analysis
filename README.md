# bank-marketing-analysis

A repository for building statistical models to evaluate a Portuguese bank's marketing efforts.

The purpose of this analysis is to predict whether or not a FUTURE customer will subscribe a bank term deposit based upon both the personal characteristics of the customer (age, gender, profession, etc) and the bank's telemarketing history for acquiring a term deposit for that customer.

Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

Results of the aforementioned methods (and possibly others) will be committed in a separate document.
